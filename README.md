3. Change into project directory: `cd startum`
4. Run `npm install` to install the libraries required by the project
5. Run `npm install -g gatsby` to install the command-line interface for Gatsby, the website generator we're using to build the site

## Developing

The website is currently one page long. The meat of the site is found in the file located at src/pages/index.js. You can edit the header/footer in the src/components directory. We're using styled-components for CSS.
